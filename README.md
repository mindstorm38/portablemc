## Installation

### Binaries

You can directly download and run the portable binaries that are pre-built and available
as assets on [release pages](https://github.com/mindstorm38/portablemc/releases).

### Cargo

![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/portablemc-cli)

If you have a Rust toolchain with Cargo, you can build and install PortableMC and its 
CLI straight from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/portablemc-cli), this is where 
the latest development versions are pushed first, before being built for specific 
targets.

```sh
cargo install portablemc-cli
```

If you are a developer willing to use PortableMC as a library to develop your own 
launcher, it is also available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/portablemc).

```sh
cargo add portablemc
```

<!-- ### With Arch Linux

For Arch Linux users, the package is available as `portablemc` in the 
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/portablemc).

## Contribute

### Contributors
This launcher would not be as functional without the contributors, and in particular the 
following for their bug reports, suggestions and pull requests to make the launcher 
better: 
[GoodDay360](https://github.com/GoodDay360), 
[Ristovski](https://github.com/Ristovski),
[JamiKettunen](https://github.com/JamiKettunen)
[MisileLaboratory](https://github.com/MisileLab) and
[GooseDeveloper](https://github.com/GooseDeveloper).

There must be a lot of hidden issues, if you want to contribute you just have to install 
and test the launcher, and report every issue you encounter, do not hesitate!

### Sponsors
I'm currently working on my open-source projects on my free time. So sponsorship is an
extra income that allows me to spend more time on the project! This can also help me
on other open-source projects. You can sponsor this project by donating either on
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mindstorm38) or 
[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/theorozier). I've always been passionate about open-source
programming and the relative success of PortableMC have been a first surprise to me, 
but the fact that people are now considering to support me financially is even more
rewarding! **Huge thanks to [Erwan Or](https://github.com/erwanor) and 
[user10072023github](https://github.com/user10072023github) for their donations!**
