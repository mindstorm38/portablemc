PortableMC -- Cross platform command line utility for launching 
Minecraft quickly and reliably with included support for Mojang 
versions and popular mod loaders.

This archive contains the files targeting a specific architect-
ure.  Next to this readme are placed the CLI executable and the 
dynamic library, note, the CLI isn't linked against the dynamic 
library, both are independent.

The 'dev/' directory contains all development files for linking
either to the dynamic library or the static library, with the C
headers and some debug symbols on Windows targets.
